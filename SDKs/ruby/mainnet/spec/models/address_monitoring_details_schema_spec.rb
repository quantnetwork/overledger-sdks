#Quant Overledger API

#Quant's Overledger API allows developers to create applications for multiple DLT's using a single standard set of operations and data structures.In order to maintain the security of private keys, most operations have two steps â€“ prepare and execute. The prepare step is the point at which all arguments are specified and standardised payloads are sent. Overledger converts this standard payload into a DLT-specific transaction object. In the execute step, the SDK signs the transaction object that Overledger created and submits it to Overledger to perform the operation  # Authentication  <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->
