#Quant Overledger API

#Quant’s Overledger API allows developers to create applications for multiple DLT’s using a single standard set of operations and data structures.In order to maintain the security of private keys, most operations have two steps – prepare and execute. The prepare step is the point at which all arguments are specified and standardised payloads are sent. Overledger converts this standard payload into a DLT-specific transaction object. In the execute step, the SDK signs the transaction object that Overledger created and submits it to Overledger to perform the operation

  # unit tests for prepare_supply_request1
  # Prepare a request to manage QRC20 token supply
  # Transforms a transaction request to manage QRC20 token supply ready to be signed and returns a request ID for executing. The supported types for this API are “Mint Tokens”, which will allow you to issue more tokens for your QRC20 token, and \&quot;Burn Tokens\&quot; which will allow you to destroy your QRC20 tokens. Successfully prepared transactions can then be executed using the /execution/transaction API.
